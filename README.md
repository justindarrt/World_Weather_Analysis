# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to develop an app, PlanMyTrip. This project takes 2000 random lat/lng coordinates and finds corresponding cities. We then use google API to find closest hotel to coordinates. The app takes in usersâ€™ min and max temperature range and finds corresponding locations that match their search. We then selected 4 cities in same country and used google maps API to suggest a travel itinerary.
